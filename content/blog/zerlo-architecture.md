# Behind Zerlo: Orchestrating Models, DSLs, and 3D Pipelines

Creating 3D games has traditionally been a resource-intensive process. It requires teams of artists, developers, and designers working together for months to bring virtual worlds to life. At Zerlo, weâ€™ve reimagined this process. By combining **AI, specialized DSLs (Domain-Specific Languages), and a robust 3D pipeline**, we empower developers to turn ideas into fully playable games faster, smarter, and more efficiently than ever before.

## 1. Understanding AI-Driven Game Development

AI-driven game development is about **leveraging machine intelligence** to automate complex tasks. Instead of manually modeling every character or coding every mechanic, AI assists in generating high-quality assets, game logic, and even adaptive gameplay.

Key applications include:  

- **Procedural content generation:** Automatically create terrains, buildings, and entire worlds.  
- **Smart design assistance:** Convert text prompts or structured instructions into 3D assets or code.  
- **Adaptive NPC behavior:** AI can generate characters that respond intelligently to player actions.  

> ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip:** Using AI doesnâ€™t replace creativity â€” it amplifies it. Developers can focus on storytelling and gameplay while AI handles repetitive or technical work.

## 2. Zerloâ€™s Pipeline: From Intent to Playable Game

Zerloâ€™s system is designed for **speed, reliability, and modularity**. Hereâ€™s how we orchestrate 3D game creation:

### 2.1 Intent Parser
Transforms natural language instructions into a structured specification.  

```text
Input: "Create a medieval city with NPCs patrolling the streets"
Output: JSON spec with levels, assets, AI behaviors
